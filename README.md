## About

This repository provides a Kindle-compatible format of the English-Ukrainian
dictionary (*Англо-український словник М.І. Балла*), a comprehensive resource
originally sourced from [bakustarver/ukr-dictionaries-list-opensource](https://github.com/bakustarver/ukr-dictionaries-list-opensource).

The dictionary has been optimized for use on Kindle devices,
enabling seamless access to translations and definitions directly within your
e-reader.
